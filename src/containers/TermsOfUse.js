                <p>
                  CryptoToons are crypto collectibles (<b>"Toons"</b>) with
                  proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This agreement does a few things. First, it passes copyright
                  ownership of a Toon from CryptoToons to the Toon Owner. The
                  Toon Owner has the copyright toon ownership. It limits the
                  rights of Toon Owners to sue CryptoToons, WebCartoons Studio
                  and The Mindhouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  CryptoToons are not an investment. They are digital art
                  collectibles.

                </h2>

                <p>
                  A. If you choose to collect or trade Toons, any financial
                  transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely
                  through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no
                  insight into or control over these payments or transactions,
                  nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With
                  that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third
                  party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of
                  any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the
                  Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct
                  via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.
                </p>
                <p>
                  B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a "Gas
                  Fee") for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum
                  network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run
                  the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will
                  need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the
                  App.
                </p>
                <p>
                  C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you sell a Toon to
                  another user of the App, you authorize us to collect a fee of
                  3.9% of the total value of that transaction.
